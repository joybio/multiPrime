#Model selection: [fast] or [normal]. 
#The degeneracy of the fast model would be higher than normal. However, the advantage of the
#fast model is that it has a shorter running time compared to the normal model.

# cluster by cd-hit
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# identity: This parameter is linked to the "-c" option in CD-HIT, with a range of 0.65 to 1. 
# We recommend setting it as 0.7 or 0.8. 
# If there is a considerable similarity among the sequences in your input file, 
# you may consider increasing this parameter to 0.9. 
# However, it's important to note that setting it to 1 will generate primers for each individual sequence.
identity: 0.7

# seq_number_ANI: The minimum sequence number in a cluster. 
# multiPrime aims to merge clusters with a size smaller than {seq_number_ANI} into larger clusters. 
# This parameter helps in reducing the total number of clusters. 
# If seq_number_ANI is set to 0, all clusters will be processed. 
# Conversely, if seq_number_ANI is set to 1, no clusters will undergo processing.
seq_number_ANI: 1
# ani: This parameter corresponds to the whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). 
# It defines the threshold for merging clusters, 
# where only clusters with an ANI value greater than {ani} will be merged. 
# The minimum value for the ANI threshold is 0.7.
ani: 0.8
# drop: This parameter determines whether to merge or drop clusters with rare sequences 
# that exhibit high ANI with other clusters. If set to "T," the clusters will be dropped. 
# If set to "F," the clusters will be merged into others.
drop: "F"

# max_seq: This parameter specifies the maximum number of sequences to be used 
# from each cluster for multi-alignment using tools such as MUSCLE or MAFFT. 
# In this step, {maxseq} sequences are randomly selected from each cluster. 
# It is important to note that this selection does not impact the 
# calculation of primer coverage in the final primer set. 
# The coverage calculation considers all sequences within the cluster to ensure accurate results.
max_seq: 500

# dege_number: This parameter, represented as "-n {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# specifies the maximum number of degenerate nucleotides allowed in a primer.
dege_number: 4
# degeneracy: This parameter, represented as "-d {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# denotes the maximum degeneracy allowed in a primer.
degeneracy: 10 
# primer_len: This parameter, represented as "-l {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# determines the length of the degenerate primers.
primer_len: 18
# variation: This parameter, represented as "-v {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# indicates the maximum number of mismatches allowed during the calculation of mis-coverage.
variation: 1
# nproc: This parameter, represented as "-p {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# defines the number of processes to be launched.
nproc: 1
# entropy: This parameter, represented as "-e {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# measures the level of disorder or variability. 
# It is used to evaluate whether a window is conserved. 
# Any primer-length window with an entropy less than 
# the specified value of {entropy} will be processed. The default value is 3.6.
entropy: 3.6
# coordinate: This parameter, represented as "-c {}" in multiPrime-core, 
# ensures that mismatch positions are not allowed at specific sites 
# within a primer during the calculation of mis-coverage.
coordinate: 2,3,-1

## get candidate primers from multiPrime output
##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# coverage: This parameter filters primers based on their match rate, 
# which is calculated as the number of sequences that match the selected primer 
# divided by the number of sequences that span the selected primer. 
# Only primers with a match rate greater than the specified fraction (default: 0.6) will be retained. 
# However, if the sequence number in some clusters is less than 10, 
# the default coverage threshold may not be suitable. 
# In such cases, you can reset the threshold. 
# Additionally, if the sequence number in some clusters is very large (greater than 100,000), 
# only a random subset of 500 sequences will be used to generate the output.
coverage: 0.7

# PRODUCT_size: This parameter filters primers based on the desired PCR product size. 
# Primers with a product size outside the specified range (default: [250, 700]) will be filtered out.
PRODUCT_size: 150,1200

# gc_content: This parameter filters primers based on their GC content. 
# Primers with a GC content outside the specified range (default: [0.45, 0.65]) will be filtered out.
gc_content: 0.2,0.7

# distance: This parameter is a filter for hairpin structures and 
# represents the minimum distance between the paired bases. 
# The default value is 4, and it is used to detect hairpin structures in the primer sequence. 
# For example, (number of X) AGCT[XXXX]AGCT.
distance: 4

# end: This parameter filters primers based on the presence of degenerate bases at the end. 
# For example, setting it to "-t 4" means that degenerate bases should not appear at the last four positions 
# during the primer pre-filtering step. The default value is 4.
end: 4

# adaptor: This parameter represents the adaptor sequence used for NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) purposes. 
# It is used for hairpin or dimer detection between the adaptor and primer. 
# Multiple adaptor sequences can be specified, separated by commas. 
# If the adaptor sequence is unknown but an adaptor is needed for subsequent sequencing, 
# the provided example sequence can be used. If no adaptor is needed, the parameter should be set as ",".
