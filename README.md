multiPrime: version 2.1.1

# Multi PCR primer pairs design processing pipeline

MultiPrime [https://multiPrime.cn](https://multiPrime.cn) is a pipeline designed for broad-spectrum detection of target sequences using tNGS. It is implemented in Python and Snakemake and takes a FASTA format file as input. The pipeline has three main steps: classification by identity, primer design, and primer set combination. In the classification step, redundant sequences are removed and clusters are formed by identity. Rare sequence clusters are compared to others by average nucleotide identity, and if they are deemed similar enough, they are merged. In the primer design step, multi-alignment is performed using MUSCLE or MAFFT, and candidate primers are designed using the nearest-neighbor model. Primer pairs are selected based on PCR product length, melting temperature, dimer examination, coverage with errors, and other factors. Finally, a greedy algorithm is used to combine primer pairs into a minimal primer set according to dimer examination.

If you only require primer design without the need for primer set combination, you may use the primer design module of MultiPrime, which is accessible through scripts/multiPrime-core.py or pip install multiPrime (version >=2.4.8) and utilize the DPrime function.

multi-DegePrime: Degenerate primer design by DEGEPRIME (MC-DPD).

multiPrime-original: Degenerate primer design by multiPrime-core (MC-EDPD or MC-DPD). It allows for avoidance of mismatches at 3'end region.

multiPrime: It is an update of original. New multiPrime allows for easy avoidance of mismatches at any position, making it flexible for experienced users.

Scripts and pipelines provided in this repository aid to design multiplex PCR primer and return a minimal primerset for multi-PCR. It contains all scripts to allow a self-assembled processing and additionally provides pipeline scripts that run the entire processing automatically.

We have provided a video tutorial at [here](https://figshare.com/articles/media/Installation_video_of_multiPrime/23904159) to assist you with the installation and usage of multiPrime.

# Why multiPrime

1) MultiPrime is a user-friendly and one-step tool for designing tNGS primer sets (cluster-specific primers or ultra multiplex PCR).
2) It integrates degenerate primer design theory with mismatch handling, resulting in improved accuracy and specificity in detecting broad spectrum sequences.
3) It outperformed conventional programs in terms of run time, primer number, and primer coverage.
4) The versatility and potential of multiPrime is highlighted by its potential application in detecting single or multiple genes, exons, antisense strands, RNA, or other specific DNA segments.

# Requirements

To run this pipeline, your computer requires **30 GB of available memory (RAM)** to process larger number of sequence (e.g. 1,000,000). **Note:** We **don't suggest** that Input sequences contains those sequences whose **length is greater than 100K**,  if necessary, you'd better set the Maxseq in yaml file as small as possible, but **do not smaller than 200**. Alternatively, you may consider using conserved genes/regions instead of whole genomes. 
Snakemake was used to facilitate the automated execution of all analysis steps. The easiest way to make use of the pipeline is to set up a python 3.9 virtual environment and run the pipeline in this environment.

# Installation and Snakemake
Snakemake is a workflow management system that helps to create and execute data processing pipelines. It requires python3 and dependent environment (multi-DegePrime == multiPrime-original == multiPrime) can be most easily installed via the bioconda package of the python anaconda distribution. 

  ```bash
  conda create -n multiPrime -c bioconda -c conda-forge --file requirement.txt
  ```
  if conflicts:
  ```bash
  conda create -n multiPrime -c bioconda -c conda-forge --file requirement2.txt
  ```
  or
 Copy multiPrime.tar.gz files from the ENV directory to your Conda environment directory and then unpack them.
  ```
  cp ENV/multiPrime.tar.gz  ${/path/to/your/conda/env}
  tar -xzvf multiPrime.tar.gz 
  conda activate multiPrime
  ```

# Activate and exit the environment
  To activate the environment 
  ```bash
  source activate multiPrime
  ```
  To exit the environment (after finishing the usage of the pipeline), just execute
  ```bash
  source deactivate
  ```
# Run the pipeline

# Configure input parameters

The working directory contains files named `multi-DegePrime.yaml`, `multiPrime-original.yaml` and `multiPrime.yaml`. These are the central file in which all user settings, paramter values and path specifications are stored. `multi-DegePrime.yaml` employs DEGEPRIME-1.1.0 for maximum coverage degenerate primer design (MC-DPD), `multiPrime-orignal.yaml` and `multiPrime.yaml` use multiPrime-core.py for MC-DPD or MC-DPD with error. During a run, all steps of the pipeline will retrieve their paramter values from these file. It follows the yaml syntax (find more information about yaml and it's syntax [here](http://www.yaml.org/)) what makes it easy to read and edit. The main principles are:
  - everything that comes after a `#` symbol is considered as comment and will not be interpreted
  - paramters are given as key-value pair, with `key` being the name and `value` the value of any paramter

Before starting the pipeline, open the `multiPrime.yaml` configuration file and set all options according as required. This should at least include:
  - **name of the input directory** - where are your input fasta files stored
	-input_dir: ["abs_path_to_input_dir"]
  - **name of the output directory** - where should the pipeline store the output files (the direcotry is created if not existing)
	-results_dir: ["abs_path_to_results_dir"]
  - **name of the log directory** - where should the pipeline store the log files
	-log_dir: ["abs_path_to_log_dir"]
  - **name of the scripts directory** - where should the pipeline store the scripts files
	-scripts_dir: ["abs_path_to"]/multiPrime/scripts
  - **name(s) of your input samples** - please note: If your sample is named `sample1.fa` then `sample1` will be kept as naming scheme throughout the entire run to indicate output files that belong to this input file, e.g. the pipeline will create a file called `sample1.fa`. If you have multiple input files, just follow the given pattern with one sample name per line (and a dash that indicates another list item).
  - **identity** - threshold for classification. please note: If you set 1, multiPrime will design candidate primer pairs for each fasta in input files. Suggestion: 0.7-0.8. 
  - **others** - for more information on the parameters, please refer to the YAML file.

# Start a run

Once you set up your configuration file, running the pipeline locally on your computer is as easy as invoking:
  ```bash
  sh run.sh
  ```
  maximal coverage degenerate primer design (MC-DPD). The approach employed DegePrime to design degenerate primers for the target sequence.
  ```bash
  snakemake --configfile multi-DegePrime.yaml -s multi-DegePrime.py --cores 10 --resources disk_mb=80000
  ```
  maximal coverage degenerate primer design with errors tolerant (MC-EDPD) or MC-DPD. MultiPrime-orignal is capable of avoiding mismatches that occur at the 3'end position. The approach used in multiPrime-orignal.yaml depends on the value of the "variation" parameter.

  If "variation" is set to 0, then multiPrime uses the MC-DPD approach to design degenerate primers for the target sequence. In this approach, the primer sequences are designed with prefect match (0-mismatch).

  If "variation" is set to a value greater than 0, then multiPrime uses the MC-EDPD approach to design degenerate primers with errors (mismatches) tolerance (1-mismatch or 2-mismatches). In this approach, the primer sequences are allowed to contain a limited number of errors (mismatches), which increases the probability of finding suitable primer sequences for the target sequence.
  ```bash
  snakemake --configfile multiPrime-orignal.yaml -s multiPrime-orignal.py --cores 10 --resources disk_mb=80000
  ```
  multiPrime is similiar to multiPrime-orignal, but it enables easy avoidance of mismatches at any position.
  ```bash
  snakemake --configfile multiPrime.yaml -s multiPrime.py --cores 10 --resources disk_mb=80000
  ```


# Start a run independently
Setting default parameters may not always be suitable for all conditions. If you want to design primers with more flexible parameters, you can install the multiPrime package through PyPI (Python Package Index) using pip.
  ```bash
  pip install multiPrime (make sure the version is latest)
  ```
  ```bash
  multiPrime --help
  ```
  The multiPrime package includes various functions for designing primers, selecting primer pairs, and calculating the coverage of these primer pairs. These features have been developed to assist researchers in performing PCR experiments efficiently and accurately. The package is continuously being improved and expanded upon, with additional functions expected to be added in the future. All manual instruction for multiPrime can be found in [here](https://pypi.org/project/multiPrime/).

If you have already cloned this repository and do not wish to install the multiPrime package from PyPI, you can use the scripts included in this repository to perform primer design. These scripts have the same functionality as the multiPrime package and can be run locally on your computer without the need for a separate installation.
  ```bash
  python {path to script}/{target}.py --help
  ```
or 
  ```bash
  python {path to script}/{target}.py
  ```

For example:
  
  Primer design with MC-DPD (--variation 0) or MC-EDPD (--variation 1 or 2. We do not recommend setting the --variation parameter greater than 2, as amplification efficiency can be severely inhibited when there are more than 2 mismatches between the primers and their targets).
